#### Windows 99 Stable
* [Live (stable)](https://windows99.vercel.app)
* [Live (development)](https://windows99dev.vercel.app)
* [Github](https://github.com/its-pablo/windows99)
* [Vercel overview](https://vercel.com/its-pablo/windows99) *requires proper permissions*  
windows99.vercel.app is the main Windows 99 site. It is completely stable, with no bugs, and is the channel you should usually use. windows99dev.vercel.app, on the other hand, is completely unstable and filled with bugs - development happens **directly on it**. Refrain from using our development server. Windows 99 is served and hosted using Vercel. Our Vercel overview is only meant for administrators to view (for now), so most of the general public cannot access this portal.
#### Windows 99 standalone signup screen
* [Github](https://github.com/its-pablo/windows99-signup-screen)
* [Live](https://windows99-signup-screen.vercel.app)  
This is the open-sourced setup screen end users view when first booting Windows 99. It does not synchronize directly with Windows 99 itself - all changes made on `windows99-signup-screen` must be reviewed manually and merged via a pull request.
#### Windows 99 Plugin
* [Github](https://github.com/its-pablo/windows99-plugin)
* [Live](https://its-pablo.github.io/windows99-plugin)
This plugin (script) should be used for all Windows 99 applications planning on being entered into the Package Manager (coming soon!) unless it does not fit the general theme of the application - exceptions are made ;)
#### 99captcha
* [Github](https://github.com/its-pablo/99captcha)
* [Live](https://its-pablo.github.io/99captcha)
This funny captcha parody is soon to be the main captcha used in forms (signup, bugs). Once we reach a large amount of visitors, Google Recaptcha will be used and the `99captcha` repository will be archived.
